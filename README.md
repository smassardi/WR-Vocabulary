# WR-Vocabulary
This repository contains a vocabulary of terms related to Wearable Robotics technologies
developed in the context of the European COST action on Wearable Robots for Augmentation, Assistance or Substitution of Human Motor Functions. 
The aim of this project is to work towards the creation of a common understanding of terms and concepts among fields of expertise involved in this field. 
The ultimate goal is to develop a shared documentation that could serve as a reference to facilitate the use of accepted definitions in the field.
The presented vocabulary was first created by including definitions discussed in different working groups composed of several experts in the field. 
The resulting document was then validated by presenting the definitions to the WR community through an online survey.
